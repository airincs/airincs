# Hello, I'm Noah!

:sparkles:
I'm on a mission to become an excellent data engineer! I have dabbled in many different areas of software development; however, data engineering has captivated me the most! I have experience as a data analyst (with some data engineering adjacent responsibilities), and I find that providing high quality data is the most important and rewarding activity a person or company can do!
